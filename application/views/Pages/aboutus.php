The best answer to dry and damaged hair, a hair spa lovingly caresses each strand of your hair, giving it the nourishment that it deserves, going right down to the roots to give you a beautiful, healthy mane that is the envy of all around you.

                     <p _ngcontent-c14=""> It is said nothing can improve your mood like a new manicure. Your hands are as important as your face, if not more so. Clean hands with perfectly and neatly painted nails can add more to your persona than you might think possible. Life is not perfect, but your nails can definitely be! Gesticulate away! </p>

                     <p _ngcontent-c14=""> A pedicure is not just a cosmetic service. It eases all the pressure from that one part on which the entire body weight falls- your feet. It also improves blood circulation and helps your nails avoid the chances of developing fungal or other such infections. And then, who doesn’t love clean, pretty feet? </p>

                     <p _ngcontent-c14=""> The harsh beating sun can cause more damage to your skin than you might think possible.

                     <h3 _ngcontent-c14="" class="crr_hdng">Facial</h3>
                     <p _ngcontent-c14=""> A facial is not just about spoiling yourself as an expert soothingly massages your face. A facial done right cleans and hydrates your skin too, getting rid of the pigmentation and dark spots, massaging the facial muscles to give you a taut, younger looking face that is aglow with good health, thanks to the increase in the blood flow. We use products containing imperative minerals and supplements that decrease wrinkles and remove the dead skin, giving you an energetic appearance. Dark mud, natural product acids, vitamins, and compounds are only a couple of the uncommon fixings found in our facials. </p>
