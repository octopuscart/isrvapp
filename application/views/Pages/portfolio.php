                        The brand is headed by Tripti Garg who was a novice in the beauty field yet her passion drew her to the crux of it. It began as a dream and practice of make-up on herself which then dragged her to engender the branch and follow the passion. She then decided to pursue it professionally and enrolled herself into the Star Make-up Academy by Ashmeen Munjaal.
